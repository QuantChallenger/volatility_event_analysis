# Write a function that will return the index of the first magical prime from an list.
# A magical prime is something we consider that the addition of two inputs from the array equals a magical prime present in the array.
# For instance, [1, 2, 15, 17, 38, 42], 2 + 15 = 17, so 17 would be our magical prime.
# In this case the function should return 3 because 17 is at the 3rd position.
# In the case you can't find a magical prime, return -1.
